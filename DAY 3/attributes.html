<p><h2>History</h2></p><hr>

<p>Hyderabad was conquered by the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"> Mughals</a> in the 1630s, and ruled by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad">Nizams</a>. Mughlai culinary traditions joined with local traditions to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabadi_cuisine" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabadi_cuisine">Hyderabadi cuisine</a>.[1] : 92  Local folklore attributes the creation of Hyderabadi biryani to the chef of the first Nizam,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam-ul-Mulk,_Asaf_Jah_I" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam-ul-Mulk,_Asaf_Jah_I"> Nizam-ul-Mulk</a>, Asaf jah I, in the mid-18th century, during a hunting expedition.[2][3] In 1857, when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal Empire</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Delhi" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Delhi">declined in Delhi</a>, Hyderabad emerged as the center of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"> South Asian </a>culture,[4][5] resulting in a mix of innovations in Hyderabadi biryani.</p>


<p><h2>Orgin</p></h2>

<p>The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. Despite legends attributing it to the Nizam's chef, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf">pilaf</a> varieties brought to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"> South Asia</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs">Arab</a> traders. Pulao may have been an army dish in medieval India. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army">Armies</a> would prepare a one-pot dish of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"> rice </a>with whichever meat was available. The distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" is arbitrary.[9][10] Hyderabadi biryani developed engrossing Deccani or Telangana flavors into it, as stated by the Himayat Ali Mirza, the great-grandson of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Osman_Ali_Khan" target="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Osman_Ali_Khan"> Mir Osman Ali Khan</a>. Himayat said that this evolution had taken place in the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizam_of_Hyderabad"> Asaf Jah’s</a> Kitchen.</p>
